# Chapter 1: Back to Evermore

The structure reveled in the wind, dark, strong and surrounded by tall trees. One by one, the students arrived, some excited, most uneasy with the constant reminder of last year's events. They were right to be so, as not every school goes through a mystical murderous event like Evermore had. But all was fine now, the school was saved, their - now undead - principal had returned and a new term was about to begin.

The blonde werewolf girl, who had fought a Hyde in defense of her best friend, was one of the few enthusiastic students - her reasons not at all related to that of her peers. She was sitting on her bed, at her, rather colorful, side of the room at Ophelia Hall. Her right leg bounced up and down, repeatedly, as she waited for her roommate Wednesday Addams.

Wednesday Addams was an odd girl. Not her fault, the Addams were indeed very kooky, as much as it took to be considered outcasts within the outcasts. That never bothered Wednesday nor her family, they were happy - or miserable, in Addams vernacular - to be the weirdos of the world, it was far more than a lifestyle. That being said, Wednesday was quite a figure; she had psychic visions, an allergy to colors and a taste for the morbid. She was also Enid's roommate and best friend.

The werewolf knew her roommie was close when she smelt her scent, it getting stronger with each passing second. That was an update: her senses were stronger than ever, thanks to her new status as an actual werewolf. She had shifted for the first time the year prior, and during a blood moon no less! It was all her parents had talked about over the break, although she had not disclosed the circumstances of her transformation for fear of what it might mean. Werewolves were supposed to be powerless during blood moons and Enid had no idea what that made her. Of course, on her first transformation with her pack, it was clear she had become a big strong wolf, as big as their current alpha - if not bigger -, but Enid had no reason to display her strength, she had focused on hunting small prey precisely for that. Her mind was set, she'd ask Wednesday for help on how to proceed.

Thinking of how lucky she was to have a roommate as intelligent and resourceful as Wednesday Addams, Enid watched a disembodied hand enter her dorm.

-- Well, hello Thing! -- The blonde greeted, a huge smile taking hold of her face.

The hand gestured excitedly.

-- How was the break, any fun?

The hand then pointed to the room entrance and tapped their fingers on the wooden floor.

-- Oh, well, I'm sure she won't mind if you tell me!

-- I will. -- Declared, in a monotone, Wednesday, who'd just entered the room. Her steady and silent pace slightly scaring Enid with her sudden appearance.

-- Wednesday! For the Moon, don't show up like that! -- The werewolf pleaded, opening her arms as a way to ask permission to hug.

-- You scare too easily, -- she stated simply, -- and yes, you may hug me this time.

Enid beamed and closed the space between them eagerly. She was beyond happy now that her best friend arrived, and even more so with the permission to hug. Wednesday was someone who set very clear boundaries and took no pleasure in physical touch, so Enid took each opportunity as a precious gift from the Moon herself.

-- I missed you so much, -- the blonde whispered, as they let go of their embrace -- did you miss me?

-- Your absence was not appreciated.

-- Wow, Willa, that's so sweet of you to say! -- Her smile was blinding, as her friend rarely admitted to feeling anything other than indifference.

-- It was merely an answer to your question, Enid. I'll get settled now, you may distract Thing if you wish.

And so did Enid, rushing to give the hand a long promised manicure and to gossip about their respective breaks. They did so as Wednesday placed her assortment of black objects carefully ordered on her side of the room. The brunette would occasionally intervene and change Thing's versions of some stories that included her, finding it extremely necessary to voice her own, more accurate, point of view.

To say the young wolf was amused was an enormous understatement. She'd never believe anyone who dared suggest she and her roommate would ever have such a natural dynamic someday. But then, looking to the other side of the room at the short brunette meticulously setting up her typewriter, the blonde couldn't help but grin. They were friends now, and her heart begged for more.

The first day back to Nevermore went by swiftly, as the students tried to catch up with each other and adorn their dorms with old and new trinkets. Unbeknownst to all but one of them, the school year promised plenty of opportunities for them to be locked up in their rooms in absolute fear of stepping out. And just before bedtime, Wednesday's new -- almost unused phone -- chimed with a new message.

# Chapter 2: Silent Mode

-- I haven't told you, but I'll need your assistance on a quite fun subject, -- Wednesday started, bringing Enid's attention to her, -- it seems I got myself a stalker, and I'm curious to find out who'd have such courage.

Enid's eyes grew wide, she was now sitting at the edge of her bed.

-- What do you mean, stalker? What happened? -- She inquired, her hands  fidgeting.

-- There's someone sending me digital messages, via mobile phone, ever since I got it, -- Wednesday scoffed, -- it's quite pathetic, as I do prefer letters written in blood, but I'm curious nonetheless.

-- Uhm, that's... -- the wolf struggled, -- isn't that, like, scary?

-- Not really, -- the brunette shrugged, -- they probably will get more courageous now that we're all back to Nevermore, so it'll be interesting.

Enid intertwined her hands, -- You're too brave, Wends, but yes, I'll help you with anything, we're friends! -- she smiled finally.


-- Good.  -- The girl responded simply, walking towards her blonde roommate's bed and sitting beside her, -- Read the messages I've received and see if they ring any bells. Maybe someone you've spoken to writes in a similar fashion.

The werewolf reached for her friend's phone and scrolled to the very first message. There weren't many, but quite expressive ones.


\\***

[Stalker] : hello addams

[Stalker] : you should not return to nevermore

[Stalker] : the school will never be safe for you

[Stalker] : ill make it dangerous

Yesterday

[Stalker] : welcome back, be ready to suffer an excruciating pain soon

\\***

  -- Well, that's creepy A.F.! But I don't really know anyone who'd write creepy stuff like that... I mean, besides you, Willa.

  Wednesday seemed to introspect on her own behavior, her head tilting slightly to the right, she then breathed deeply as if meditating.

  -- I figured so, Nevermore does not have followers of the dark arts as it had in its golden age.

  Saying that, the brunette simply resigned  herself to her own bed. As she placed her hands on her chest and prepared to sleep, her mind drifted in thoughts of an exciting new year.

...

  
In the morning, as Enid woke up, Wednesday was nowhere to be found, leaving behind a perfectly made bed, with no signs of someone ever sleeping on it. Enid was always impressed by her roommate's neatness and waking hours; she could only pray her wolf would allow her to awake soon enough for class. With a big yawn and stretching her limbs lazily, she got ready for the day.

Their first class that day was not the most exciting, History, of all things, should not be that boring! But their teacher just wasn't the best, an over 200 year old vampire who spoke incredibly slow as if every student had a century to spend in his class. Wednesday, obviously, was the only who seemed engaged in his classes, always taking notes diligently. Enid thought that that was cute, to see her roommate all focused and stuff, but she herself could not avoid getting her own phone and scrolling mindlessly.

  As soon as the class finished the students all scrambled to get out of the classroom and to the Quad for lunch. Enid hurried out as well, but waited for Wednesday in the corridor.

-- Enid, -- the brunette started as she approached her friend -- I've had new developments today. During class, it appears.

  Enid frowned, -- Really? Dang it, I was too distracted on my phone to notice everyone else!

  -- Well, there is no reason to believe the stalker can only be someone from our class, -- Wednesday argued.

-- That's true, but still...

Their discussion was interrupted by a tap on Wednesday's left shoulder, -- Hello, Thing, -- she greeted the hand -- anything new?

Thing answered in Morse code on her shoulder, "What were the messages this time?", it asked.

Wednesday grabbed her phone from her pocket and showed the contents of the one sided conversation with her stalker.

 
\\***

[Stalker] : hello addams

[Stalker] : you look dreadful today


[Stalker] : meet me in the library. midnight.

\\***

  

Enid glanced worried at her friend, -- You're not going, right? --, she asked knowing that her friend would do just that.

-- Why shouldn't I? -- Wednesday asked, unfazed, -- It is surely a fast development of this whole stalker project, but I would not mind murdering someone tonight.

Chuckling, Enid ran her fingers through her hair, -- You know what, Wends, I don't even know why I asked!

The rest of the day went by uneventfully, with Enid trying to reason her roommate out of that creepy meeting with a, from what she argued, complete stranger. Wednesday would not reconsider though, explaining precisely why she had no reason to fear the stalker, she didn't fear anything else anyway.

As the night crept in, Ophelia hall quivered with anxiety, two of its residents overly excited in their own different ways. The precise ticking of a clock was bothering the ears of a blond werewolf.

-- I'll go with you, -- Enid stated.

Wednesday, who'd noticed her friend's growing worries, decided to allow it, so she simply replied with a "If you must", and, as the clock settled at eleven, Enid followed Wednesday out of their room, her hands deep in her pocket.

Wednesday began to explain to Enid that she shouldn't worry that much, she had weapons concealed all over her body, when she heard the sound of air moving fast, as if being cut by something. She didn't have time to process it though, only registering Enid catching it mid air. The werewolf's hand was dripping in blood. She caught an arrow.




# mother

She hurried away from the property with Enid in her arms and her brother right after, watching their backs. Enid looked pale and fragile like never before and that worried her deeply; all she wanted was to get home and care for her dear as quickly as possible.

Pugsley had gotten a message from their parents, informing that they had just arrived at the airport and were waiting for them. They didn't even question if things had worked or not, just assumed.

Luckly, both sibilings had a lot experience riding motorcycles, so their equilibrium allowed Pugsley to pilot with Wednesday carrying Enid in her arms, facing away from him. Pugsley took the motorcycle to it's speed limit, riding past cars, with shocked drivers, without faltering.

A tranquil Morticia and a smirking Gomez were awaiting right at the entrance, Gomez holding a considerable first aid kit.

-- Bring her to me, darling, -- Morticia directed Wednesday, as fished out a small drop shaped flask filled with a translucid green liquid.

-- Be careful with her, mother, what is it? -- She held Enid in her arms, now close to Morticia, her father placed his hand on the back of Enid's head, slightly pushing it upwards.

Morticia opened the flask, which caused it to hiss and let out little bubbles, and dropped it's content on Enid's forehead.

-- It will replenish the nutrients her body certainly needs, given the state she's in, -- She  gestured to Enid's bruises, all over her arms and legs, -- we have plenty of those on our emergency kits, I made them myself. -- Her eyes drifted back to her husband, -- Although I do prefer potions that drain the life out of someone, -- she smiled.

-- We need to get home quickly, Enid needs to rest, -- Wednesday said, ignoring her mother's remarks, -- I reckon the jet is ready?

-- Absolutely, Lurch awaits for us.






Pugsley recounted the details of their encounter with the Sinclair clan with every detail he could remember, describing vividly the effects of each of his arrows, his sister's knives and Enid's bites and claws. His parents and grandmother listened excitedly, their eyes glistening with pride.

At another part of the house, Wednesday watched over as Enid slept quietly at her bed. Her heart felt much lighter now, although she still worried about how Enid might react when she woke up. She knew how much it affected Enid, knowing she had hurt someone else. She wished she could teach Enid that some people deserved to suffer, to feel pain, to bleed.

Unaware of her surroundings, Enid dreamt of Wednesday, of good days at Nevermore.






When she woke up, Wednesday was sitting right beside her, watching her keenly. She felt weird but couldn't quite tell why. Her body felt fine, although she didn't remember the last time she'd eaten.

-- Well, good morning, meu amor.

She stiffened as she remembered she should be away from Wednesday, that she hurt her last time, -- How am I here?

Wednesday's eyes were soft and curious, -- You don't remember what happened?

-- What do you mean? What happened? -- Her eyes grew as her brows pushed them down at the same time.

The Addams moved to touch Enid's face softly, but the girl retreaded quickly, as if Wednesday's hands would burn her, -- Meu bem, do not worry, everything is alright, we rescued you, you are safe now, it'll all come back to you.

She got up from her seat and moved to the door, -- Rest, and you will remember.

Enid watched as her beloved left closed the door behind her and, as the door clicked closed, it hit her. Her mother.



# daughter

It hit her like a violent wave at the sea, filling up her nostrils with painful salted water. Her mother at her feet, curling up in pain. The pain she caused -- again.

She should've been dead by now. As her mother wanted. But Wednesday saved her, her best friend, her biggest passion. What could she do now, that her most loved person in the world was standing right beside her, while her mother was probably somewhere agonizing? 

She wondered what kind of daughter she was now. Only a few months ago she was a failure, an abnormality in the family line, a disappointment to her mother -- but now, what was she? All of that and so much more, so much worse.

Her breath quickened, her eyes fell shut as her mind went places darker than she had ever dreamed of.

-- I'm a monster.

Wednesday, whose eyes had never left Enid for a second ever since they got home, tried to understand, -- How could you be?

-- I hurt my own mother, Wednesday.

-- Not enough, you barely touched her, -- her head leaned to the right.

-- You act as if this was nothing, but people don't hurt their families, -- Enid responded, her voice rising, -- not everybody is like you and your family!

As exasperated as she sounded, Wednesday still kept her own demeanor as still as she always was, -- I understand. I do believe you have not done anything wrong, as all you did was out of the instinct for survival.

-- Why should I survive? I don't even have a family now. You should've left me there to burn, -- she fell into the bed.

Wednesday's face wavered, -- I'd love for nothing more than to burn with you. But I could never turn my back on you. -- She fell beside Enid, -- You'll live long, as you deserve to. You are a good person, Enid, you will never be alone for as long as I live.

Enid didn't voice it, but she wished she could scream her love then and there, she wished she could cry and beg to be cared for. Her brain stopped her from doing anything, so she just laid there, in silence.


They fell asleep shortly after.






Morticia Addams was a resolute woman. Her husband took pride on her way of standing her ground. Her decisions were often the orders he took to his heart. When she claimed the young werewolf, Enid, as their family, he obviously accepted it without further questioning.

He already loved the girl, ever since he met her. She was good to Wednesday, and that was more than he could ever ask for, besides, the girl was endearing and incredibly dangerous, an Addams favorite.

So when a angry woman showed up at their porch days later after they had rescued Enid, claiming the girl as her daughter and demanding he handed her, he couldn't help but scoff.

-- Ma'am this is a private residence, -- he answered, at the manor's gates, -- I advise you to leave, these gates can be very violent and the surrounding grounds are even less merciful with trespassers, -- he grinned, -- I'd love to have a good hunting though, so it's up to you.

The woman, carrying unhealed cuts all over her face and a brown leather satchel bag, grunted, -- I'm her mother, you and your creepy little family have taken her from me, _I advise you_ to give her back, -- she showed him her teeth as they morphed into fangs.

-- Creepy is okay, but we prefer kooky, spooky even, -- he smiled, showing her all his teeth as well, then turned and walked away from the gates.


-- Who was that, darling? -- His wife asked, soon as he reached the porch.

-- An unwelcome guest, mon cher, -- he took her hand and kissed it, -- Enid's progenitress. 

-- Oh, I see, have you let out the hyenas? -- She caressed his hand in return.

-- Of course, mon amour, let's hope they have a feast.
