An original character is infatuated with Enid and tries to hurt Wednesday in mysterious ways, both Enid and Wednesday try to figure that out.

The attacks on Wednesday are believed to be the Stalkers fault so Enid goes out of her way to figure out who's framing her.

# Chapter 1: Back to Evermore
The structure revelled in the wind, dark, strong and surrounded by tall trees. One by one, the students arrived, some excited, most uneasy with the constant reminder of last year's events. They were right to be so, as not every school goes through a mystical murderous event like Evermore had. But all was fine now, the school was saved, their - now undead - principal had returned and a new term was about to begin.

The blonde werewolf girl, who had fought a hyde in defense of her best friend, was one of the few enthusiastic students - her reasons not at all related to that of her peers. She was sitting on her bed, at her, rather colorful, side of the room at Ophelia Hall. Her right leg bouced up and down, repeatedly, as she waited for her roomate Wednesday Addams.

Wednesday Addams was an odd girl. Not her fault, the Addams were indeed very kooky, as much as it took to be considered outcasts within the outcasts. That never bothered Wednesday nor her family, they were happy - or miserable, in Addams vernacular - to be the weirdos of the world, it was far more than a lifestyle. That being said, Wednesday was quite a figure; she had psychic visions, an allergy to colors and a taste for the morbid. She was also Enid's roomate and best friend.

The werewolf knew her roomie was close when smelt her sent, it getting stronger with each passing second. That was an update: her senses were stronger than ever, thanks to her new status as an actual werewolf. She had shifted for the first time the year prior, and during a blood moon no less! It was all her parents had talked about over the break, although she had not disclosed the circunstances of her transformation for fear of what it might mean. Werewolves were supposed to be powerless during blood moons and Enid had no idea what that made her. Of course, on her first transformation with her pack, it was clear she had become a big strong wolf, as big as their current alpha - if not bigger -, but Enid had no reason to display her strenght, she had focused on hunting small preys precisely for that. Her mind was set, she'd ask Wendnesday for help on how to proceed. 

Thinking of how lucky she was to have a roomate as intelligent and resourful as Wednesday Addams, Enid watched a disembodied hand enter her dorm.

-- Well, hello Thing! -- The blonde greeted, a huge smile taking hold of her face.

The hand gestured excitedly.

-- How was the break, any fun?

The hand then pointed to the room entrance and tapped their fingers on the wooden floor.

-- Oh, well, I'm sure she won't mind if you tell!

-- I will. -- Declared, in a monotone, Wednesday, who'd just entered the room. Her steady and silent pace slightly scaring Enid with her sudden appearence. 

-- Wednesday! For the Moon, don't show up like that! -- The werewolf pleaded, opening her arms as a way to ask permission to hug.

-- You scare too easily, -- she stated simply, -- and yes, you may hug me this time.

Enid beamed and closed the space between them eagerly. She was beyond happy now that her bestfriend arrived, and even more so with the permission to hug. Wednesday was someone who set very clear boudaries and took no pleasure in physical touch, so Enid took each opportunity as precious gift from the Moon herself.

-- I missed you so much, -- the blonde whispered, as they let go of their embrace -- did you miss me?

-- Your absence was not appreciated.

-- Wow, Willa, that's so sweet of you to say! -- Her smile was blinding, as her friend rarely admitted to feel anything other than indiference.

-- It was merely an answer to your question, Enid. I'll get settled now, you may distract Thing if you wish.

And so did Enid, rushing to give the hand a long promised manicure and to gossip about their respective breaks. They did so as Wednesday placed her assortment of black objects carefully ordered on her side of the room. The brunette would occasionally intervene and change Thing's versions of some stories that included her, finding extremely necessary to voice her own, more accurate, point of view. 

To say the young wolf was amused was a enormous understatement. She'd never believe anyone who dared suggest she and her roomate would ever have such a natural dynamic someday. But then, looking to the other side of the room at the short brunette meticulously setting up her typewriter, the blonde couldn't help but grin. They were friends now, and her heart eagered for more.

The first day back to Nevermore went by swiftly, as the students tried to catch up with each other and adorn their dorms with old and new trinkets. Unbeknownst to all but one of them, the school year promised plenty of opportunities for them to be locked up in their rooms in absolute fear of stepping out. And just before bedtime, Wednesday's new -- almost unused phone -- chimed with a new message.

# Chapter 2: Silent Mode
-- I haven't told you, but I'll need your assistance on a quite fun subject, -- Wednesday started, bringing Enid's attention to her, -- it seems I got myself a _stalker_, and I'm curious to find out who'd have such courage.

Enid's eyes grew wide, she was now sitting at the edge of her bed.

-- What do you mean, stalker? What happened? -- She inquired, her hands  fidgeting.

-- There's someone sending me digital messages, via mobile phone, ever since I got it, -- Wednesday scoffed, -- it's quite pathetic, as I do prefer letters written in blood, but I'm curious nonetheless. 

-- Uhm, that's... -- the wolf struggled, -- isn't that, like, scary?

-- Not really, -- the brunette shrugged, -- they probably will get more corageous now that we're all back to Nevermore, so it'll be interesting.

Enid intertwined her hands, -- You're too brave, Willa, but yes, I'll help you with anything, we're friends! -- she smiled finally.

-- Good.  -- The girl responded simply, walking towards her blonde roomate's bed and sitting beside her, -- Read the messages I've received and see if they ring any bells. Maybe someone you've spoken to writes in a similar fashion.

The werewolf reached for her friend's phone and scrolled to the very first message. There weren't many, but quite expressive ones.

\***
[Stalker] : hello addams
[Stalker] : you should not return to nevermore
[Stalker] : the school will never be safe for you
[Stalker] : ill make it dangerous
_Yesterday_
[Stalker] : welcome back, be ready to suffer an excrutiating pain soon
\*** 

-- Well, that's creepy A.F.! But I don't really know anyone who'd write creepy stuff like that... I mean, besides you, Willa.

Wednesday seemed to introspect on her own behaviour, her head tilting slightly to the right, she then breathed deeply as if meditating.

-- I figured so, Nevermore does not have followers of the dark arts as it had in its golden age.

Saying that, the brunette simply resigned  herself to her own bed. As she placed her hands on her chest and prepared to sleep, her mind drifted in thoughts of an exciting new year.

...

In the morning, as Enid woke up, Wednesday was nowhere to be found, leaving behind a perfectly made bed, with no signs of someone ever sleeping on it. Enid was always impressed by her roomate's neatness and waking hours; she could only pray her wolf would allow her to awake soon enough for class. With a big yawn and stretching her limbs lazily, she got ready for the day.
