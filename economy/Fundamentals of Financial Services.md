# Fundamentals of Financial Services

## Basic concepts and products

#### Products

> **Derivatives**

Derivatives are financial products. Their prices are based on
the prices of underlying assets, e.g.: oil, bonds, shares, etc.

>  **Hedges** (Cobertura)

Hedges are investment positions intended to offset potential
losses or gains that may be incured by a companion investment:
e.g.: buying corn before it produces to avoid rising prices or
selling to avoid lowering prices in the future

> **Future**

A contract of pre agreed goods, tradeable and that can be
 negociated on price, is called a future

> **Forward**

Forward contracts cannot be negociated

> **Options**

There are types of options:

**Call**: the buyer can buy a good at a pre-agreed _exercise price_ 
and the seller must deliver it _immediately_

**Put**: the buyer can sell the _derivative's_  underlying asset
at the _exercise price_ and the seller takes delivery and pays out
the buyer

In both cases the buyer pays out a _premium_ to obtain these options,
which is non-refundable


##### Stocks


> **Stock exchange indices**

Amalgamate the prices of all stocks of a sector as a
single headline figure, e.g.:

- FTSE 100: UK's top 100 listed companies
- DJIA: 30 largest US market companies
- NASDAQ: US technology companies
- NIKKEI 225: Japan's top companies
- Hang Seng: HK China companies
- S&P500: 500 companies from NYSE or NASDAQ
- DAX: Germany companies


> **Fund**

Is a collection of investors who invest their money into a fund,
the money is then invested in certain assets. That investment is
managed by a _fund manager_ who decides where those investments go.

A direct investment, that is, solely investing into a single asset,
can be risky, whilst collective investment is more diverse. Because
a _fund pools together_ all investors money, smaller investments are
still accepted if a full share is too expensive for an investor.


> **Foreign exchange**

Is trading different currencies. Given that the prices vary
from one currency to another, and are rarely a direct conversion.

> **Pensions**

Are meant to be used after retirement and it's sources are:
personal funding, State funding, employer funding and investment
funding (pension scheme).

> **Indicators**

There are a couple types of market indicators:

- Leading indicators: any measures of _macroeconomic_ data that
indicates what the health of the economy will loke like in the
immediate _future_, e.g.: new unemployment claims.

- Coincident indicators: _macroeconomic_ data that indicates the
health of the economy in the _present_.

- Lagging indicators: tend to confirm what the economy has _already_
begun to do.

- Sentiment indices: how _people feel_ about the economy. Although
less reliable then the others, can often predict the behavior of
consumers in the present and future.

> Pensions

- **State pension funding**: money contributed by the government towards one's pension. It usually not for a comfortable retirement.

- **Employer pension funding**: money contributed by the firm of an employee towards their pension; the employee will, sometimes, be required to contribute a small to the scheme.

> Fintech

Financial technology explores technological advancement to help the financial services industry.

- Crowdfunding: start-ups will often use this type of investment in which a group of people will invest on the start-up through a platform, such as Kickstarter, in exchange for benefits.
- DLT (Distributed ledger technology): a decentralized ledger, as in each computer has a copy. Benefits highly on cybersecurity and is used for cryptocurrencies that operate with the blockchain.
