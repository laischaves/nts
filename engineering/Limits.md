# Limits

**Definition**:
$\lim_{x\to a}f(x)=L$ if for every $\varepsilon >0$ there
is a $\delta > 0$ such that whenever $0<|x-a|<\delta$ then
$|f(x)-L|<\varepsilon$  !meaning?

$\lim_{x\to a}f(x)=L$ if we can make $f(x)$ as close to $L$
as we want, by taking $x$ sufficiently close to $a$ (on either
side) without ever letting $x=a$.

**At infinity $\infty$**:
$\lim_{x\to \infty}f(x)=L$ if we can make $f(x)$ as close to $L$
as we want, by taking $x$  large enough and positive (negative
for $\lim_{x\to -\infty}f(x)=L$)


- **Right hand limit**: requires x > a.

- **Left hand limit**: requires x < a.

**One sided limits and _the limit_**:
- If the right hand limit is _equal to_ the left hand limit
then _the limit_ exists.
- If the right hand limit is _not equal to_ the left hand limit
then _the limit_ does not exist.

A function's continuity can be defined with the aid of
limits: If $f(x)$ is continuous at $a$ then
$\lim_{x\to a}f(x)=f(a)$
