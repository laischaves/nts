## Heat Transmission

Conservation Law
> The sum of heat exchange ($Q$) in a system equals 0
> > $Q_1 + Q_2 + Q_3 + ... Q_n = 0$

We say if water is ==compressed== if its temperature is ==smaller== than
the necessary to vaporize it.

We say its ==saturated== when the material is on a temperature ==extremely
close== to vaporizing it.

$$Q = mc(\Delta\theta)$$
In which $Q$ is thermal energy, $m$ is mass and $c$ is specific heat (given
in either J/kg°C, cal/g°C, etc)

$$Q = m\cdot L$$
In which $L$ is latent heat.

$$q = \frac{Q}{t}, \space q_k = -kA\frac{dT}{dx}, \space q_k\propto A\frac{dT}{dx}$$

In which, $q$ is heat transfer, $Q$ is amount of heat transfer, $t$ time of transfer
$A$ is area, $k$ is thermal conductivity (given in $W/m\cdot K$).

$$R_k = \frac{L}{Ak}$$
With $R_k$ being thermal resistance.

==The bigger the conductivity, the bigger the heat exchange.==

There are two convection types: Natural and Forced/Induced. Heat Transmission
by convection occurs on fluids, liquids and gas.

Properties that influence convection are: _density, viscosity, velocity,
thermoconductivity, specific heat and surface geometry._

The equation for fluid/plate interface:
$$q_{c} = -K_{fluid} A|\frac{\partial T}{\partial y}|\space\text{at } y = 0$$

Newton's equation for refrigerators:
$$q_{c} = \overbar{h_{c}} A\Delta T$$
With $h_{c}$ being the average heat transfer by convections for tubes coefficient.
