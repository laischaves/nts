# Electromagnetism

## Quick definitions

**Impedance** $Z$:
- Equation
> $$Z=\sqrt{R^2(X_L - X_C)^2}$$
- is used to calculate current amplitude

**Current amplitude** $I$:
- Equation:
> $$I=\frac{\text{electromotive force phasor}}{Z}$$

**RLC phasors**:
- the projection of the phasors on the y-axis represents their value at a _t_ time, while their lenght represents their absolute value
