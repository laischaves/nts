# Laís’ Notes

- **Basic types of servers and hosting**
    - **Dedicated server**: runs on one single machine, dedicated to a single business (will run an app/site) → *high cost, high maintenance, high security (mostly)*
    - **VPS (Virtual Private Service)**: one physical machine virtualized into sub-machines (can run multiple apps/sites) → *better utilization and isolation of resources*
    - **Shared hosting**: one physical machine, shared by multiple businesses, relying on most tenants under-utilizing their resources → *cheap, limited functionality, poor isolation*
    - **Cloud hosting**: multiple physical machines acting as a single system that is abstracted into multiple cloud services → *flexible, scalable, secure, cost-effective, configurable, isolated*
- **Amazon Web Services**
    - Collection of web services that can be used under a unique API
- **CSP**
    - means cloud service provider, which is a company that provides multiple cloud services, which can be chained together, those can have observability, metered billing, and can be accessible via Single Unified API
- **Landscape of CSPs**
    - Tier 1: early to market, wide offering, good ecosystems (AWS, Azure, GCP, Alibaba)
    - Tier 2: backed by good and well-known companies, mid-tier and sometimes specialised on specific types of services (IBM, Oracle, Huawei, Tencent)
    - Tier 3 - VPS offering more IaaS (infrastructure as a service), light-tier, simples and cheaper (Vultr, Digital Ocea, Akamai (Linode))
    - Tier 4 - IaaS software hosted locally to get cloud run services in-house (OpenStack, Apache Cloudstack)
- **Gartner Magic Quadrant (MQ) for Cloud**
    - Is a series of research reports about cloud providers and resources on the market published by the IT consulting firma Gartner
    - Useful to keep up with market trends and services evolution (on the full reports)
- **AWS Budgets**
	- Allows the creation of budgets for the AWS account, which can be used for alerts and actions concerning the reach of any threshold adopted by the user.
	- You can also use CloudWatch to create billing alerts.
- **SNS**
