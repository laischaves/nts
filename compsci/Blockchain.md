# Blockchain

A blockchain is basically a digital _ledger_ mechanism; another
definition would be that a blockchain is a database type
with a specific networking system.

Blockchains are said to be descentralized, distributed databases.
In this type of database, users may opt to host their own copies
of the database, those copies are called **nodes**. The user can
also opt for accessing the database through a provider.

Blockchains work with public and private keys: **Public keys** are
like addresses, or destinations, to which transactions are directed
to. **Private keys** are used to sign those transactions.

Each transaction in a blockchain must be verified, and such
verifications are done through computational power provided by
**miners** -- users who choose to provide such tools. These
verifications provide proof of work and approval by consensus,
which mean the same transaction will be verified by multiple
miners in order to be deemed valid.
