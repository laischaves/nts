# Energy Conversion

###### Class notes

- Works to rise/lower an input voltage, or as a security device;
- DC machines allow for more control, but are more expensive. 
- It's common practice to use lower case letters to represent those instantaneous values.
- A phasor can be described as rotating vector, or a vectorial function on time.
- By connecting 3 transformer nuclei (star, triangle) we get a three-phased transformer.
- Three-phased transformers are usually built using a single adapted nucleous, for optimization.
- A three-phased transformer also allows for a smaller dispersion flux comparing it to a single phase transformer.
- The losses by ==histerese== are usually caused by the friction of molecules trying to adapt to the orientation of the magnetic field generated.
- Knowing a transformer's polarity is useful when you wish to connect two or more transformers. 
  
  
## Transformers

### Faraday-Lenz Law

The change in magnetic flux on a conductor over time generates an electromotive force $\rightarrow$ EMF ($E=\frac{W}{Q}$) (Faraday), Lenz contributed with the negative sign in the equation that means that a varying flux induces an EMF on the opposing direction of the applied voltage.

$$e = -\frac{d\phi}{dt} = -\frac{\Delta\phi}{\Delta t}$$

$$\vec{\Phi}=\vec{B}\times S$$
