# Energy Conversion

###### Quick Class notes

- Works to rise/lower an input voltage, or as a security device;
- DC machines allow for more control, but are more expensive. 
- It's common practice to use lower case letters to represent those instantaneous values.
- A phasor can be described as rotating vector, or a vectorial function on time.
- By connecting 3 transformer nuclei (star, triangle) we get a three-phased transformer.
- Three-phased transformers are usually built using a single adapted nucleous, for optimization.
- A three-phased transformer also allows for a smaller dispersion flux comparing it to a single phase transformer.
- The losses by ==histerese== are usually caused by the friction of molecules trying to adapt to the orientation of the magnetic field generated.
- Knowing a transformer's polarity is useful when you wish to connect two or more transformers. 
  
  
## Transformers

### Faraday-Lenz Law

The change in magnetic flux on a conductor over time generates an electromotive force $\rightarrow$ EMF ($E=\frac{W}{Q}$) (Faraday), Lenz contributed with the negative sign in the equation that means that a varying flux induces an EMF on the opposing direction of the applied voltage.

$$e = -\frac{d\phi}{dt} = -\frac{\Delta\phi}{\Delta t}$$

$$\vec{\Phi}=\vec{B}\times S$$

### Ideal Transformer
1. No losses (power)
2. No dispersion flux (dispersed flux does not induce EMF)
3. Power on the first = Power on the second: $P_1 = P_2$

The transforming ratio is the same as the coil ratio; $a = \frac{n_1}{n_2}$, with n being the number of coils.

**Example**
Considering a = 10, $i_1 = 10A,\space v_1 = 10V$
$$i_2 = ?, \space v_2 = 100V$$
$$P_1 = P_2$$
$$v_1 i_1= v_2 i_2$$
$$i_1 = i_2 \frac{v_2}{v_1} = i_2\frac{N_2}{N_1}$$
$$\rightarrow i_2 = i_1\frac{1}{a},\space i_2=ai_1, \space i_1=\frac{i_2}{a}$$
$$\frac{i_1}{i_2}=\frac{N_2}{N_1}=\frac{1}{a}$$

**Ideal core (? trafo):** $e_1 = v_1, \space e_2 = v_2$
Therefore, $a = \frac{e_1}{e_2} = \frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{v_1}{v_2}$

$$\frac{i_1}{i_2}=\frac{1}{a}, \space\space\frac{z_1}{z_2}=a^2$$

### Lorentz' law and force
$$\vec{F} = \vec{i} \^ \vec{B}\times\space L$$
