# Integral
**Definite Integral**: Suppose f(x) is continuous
on [a,b]. Divide [a, b] into *n* subintervals of
width $\Delta x$ and choose $x^*_i$ from each interval.

Then $\int^b_a f(x)dx = \lim_{n\to\infty}\sum^n_{i=1}f(x^*_i)\Delta x$

**Anti-Derivative**: An anti-derivative of f(x)
is a function, F(x), such that F'(x) = f(x).

## Improper Integrals

An improper integral is an integral with one or more infinite [[limits]]
and/or discontinuous integrands.
Integral is called convergent if the limit exists and has a finite
value and divergent if the limit doesnâ€™t exist or has infinite value.
Improper integrals must be solved by converting it to a limit.
We should make sure that the integral converges (i.e. the limit
exists and is finite).
