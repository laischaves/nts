**Derivatives:** The derivative of a function is the rate at which the function changes with respect to its input.

Derivative Notation: $f'(x) = \frac{df}{dx} = \frac{d}{dx}(f(x))$

Common Derivatives:

-   Constant: $\frac{d}{dx}(c) = 0$
-   Power Rule: $\frac{d}{dx}(x^n) = nx^{n-1}$
-   Exponential: $\frac{d}{dx}(e^x) = e^x$
-   Logarithmic: $\frac{d}{dx}(\ln(x)) = \frac{1}{x}$
-   Trigonometric: $\frac{d}{dx}(\sin(x)) = \cos(x), \frac{d}{dx}(\cos(x)) = -\sin(x), \frac{d}{dx}(\tan(x)) = \sec^2(x)$

**Integration:** Integration is the process of finding the area under a curve.

Integral Notation: $\int f(x) dx$

Common Integrals:

-   Constant: $\int c dx = cx + C$ (where C is the constant of integration)
-   Power Rule: $\int x^n dx = \frac{1}{n+1} x^{n+1} + C$
-   Exponential: $\int e^x dx = e^x + C$
-   Logarithmic: $\int \frac{1}{x} dx = \ln|x| + C$
-   Trigonometric: $\int \sin(x) dx = -\cos(x) + C, \int \cos(x) dx = \sin(x) + C$

**Limits:** Limits are used to describe the behavior of a function as the input approaches a certain value.

Limit Notation: $\lim\limits_{x\to a} f(x) = L$

Common Limits:

-   Constant: $\lim\limits_{x\to a} c = c$
-   Power Rule: $\lim\limits_{x\to a} x^n = a^n$
-   Exponential: $\lim\limits_{x\to\infty} e^x = \infty, \lim\limits_{x\to-\infty} e^x = 0$
-   Logarithmic: $\lim\limits_{x\to 0} \ln(x) = -\infty$
-   Trigonometric: $\lim\limits_{x\to 0} \frac{\sin(x)}{x} = 1$

**Chain Rule:** The chain rule is used to find the derivative of a composition of functions.

Chain Rule: $\frac{d}{dx}(f(g(x))) = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x)$

**Product Rule:** The product rule is used to find the derivative of the product of two functions.

Product Rule: $\frac{d}{dx}(f(x)g(x)) = f(x)g'(x) + f'(x)g(x)$

**Quotient Rule:** The quotient rule is used to find the derivative of the quotient of two functions.

Quotient Rule: $\frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\right) = \frac{g(x)f'(x) - f(x)g'(x)}{[g(x)]^2}$
