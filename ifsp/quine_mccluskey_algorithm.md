# The Quine-McCluskey Algorithm Explained
## A.K.A. QMC or _method of prime implicants_

**QMC** is a method used for minimizing _Boolean functions_, developed
by Willard V. Quine (1952) and extended by Edward J. McCluskey (1956).
(WIKIPEDIA, 2022)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine%E2%80%93McCluskey_algorithm]

The method has a tabular form that makes it easier to use
in computer algorithms, it's also a deterministic way to check
if the minimal form of the boolean function has been found.

The method requires that you first find
the prime implicants of the function and
later define the **essential** and/or _necessary_ prime implicants
 to define and cover the whole function.
