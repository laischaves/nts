# How We Learn

Encondig is key. Rehearse as well. 

**Enconding:**

1. Increase focus and attention

2. Curiosity based learning: ask questions

3. Learn by scope: lean overall idea, then get into specifics scopes
so your brain can attach importance to the subject; priming

4. Chunking: chunk pieces of information together, group concepts, 
creating stories, etc.

5. Interleaving: take concepts and create relationships between them,
speacially if they're in different scopes or disciplines


**Rehersal:**

Fill in the gaps of the first chunking; get more info with
different mediums, repeat a couple of times.


**Retrieval:**

Test yourself, application based learning, practice test;
