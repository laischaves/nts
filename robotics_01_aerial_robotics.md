The UAV's (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) market is growing,
with an industry worth more than $10 Billion.

- Military
- Civilian (comercial)
- Civilian (private)

==Drones are remotely controled==

#### Rotor crafts:
- Helicopters
- Ducted fan
- Co-axial
- Quadrotor
- Hexrotor


##### Quadrotor
- Giroscopic moment
Has 4 independently controlled rotors,
2 rotating clockwise, 2 anticlockwise; the speed of each helps
define the position and orientation of the robot

The whole motion of the vehicle can be complicated.

The robot has six degrees of freedom;
- It can move in the XYZ plane, and it can rotate.
- It can perform 3 translational movements and 3
rotational movements.




## Key Components for Automonomous Flight

1. State Estimation
 "Obtain reliable estimates of position and velocity"
In lab:
 - External motion capture cameras;
 - Reflective markers;
Outside of a lab:
- GPS; Communication;
- (Varied) Sensors;
- SLAM: (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)
> Estimates the location of features in the environments
> Estimates the position and orientation of the robot
> with respect to the environment



2. Control
3. Mapping
4. Planning


### Things to be organized
**IMU**: A device that measures and reports a body's specific force,
angular rate and sometimes orientation of the body.
It combines accelerometers and gyroscopes (sometimes magnetometers).
